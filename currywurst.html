    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Currywurst is widely considered to be the ultimate German street food.  The lovers of this dish are ardent about what should and should not go into the perfect currywurst sauce.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>Bratwursts</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Tomato Ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of Baking Soda</li>
        <li>4-5 teaspoons of Mild Curry Powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Onion Powder</li>
        <li>1/8 - 1/4 teaspoons of Cayenne Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Liquids:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons of Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons of Beef Broth</li>
        <li>2 (or more) tablespoons of Water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Variations</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>You can easily sub the beef broth for veggie broth and use vegan Worcestershire sauce to make this a vegetarian dish. While I haven’t tried it yet, I really feel like this sauce would go great on vegetarian sausages too.</li>

      <li>I use a full 5 teaspoons of curry powder because I feel that gives it the best flavour. Using 4 is tasty too, though.</li>
        
      <li>Feel free to omit the cayenne pepper completely if you don’t like a lot of spice. 1/4 definitely gives it a solid kick.  Mild curry powder already has a minor, teeny kick on its own.</li>
        
      <li>If you can’t get or don’t want to invest in smoked paprika, I’m thinking that using liquid smoke and sweet paprika would work. I specifically used smoked paprika for that smokiness. I wouldn’t be surprised if once you start using this spice, you’ll always want it on hand. It’s expensive, if you don’t nab when it’s on sale, but it’s really wonderful.</li>
        
      <li>If you don’t have any (or want any) paprika, this recipe should still work without it.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Put one cup of ketchup into a small saucepan on medium low heat. We want to warm up the ketchup for a few minutes for our next step.</li>
      <li>When it’s nice and warm, drop in the 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda. Yes, you heard me right – NaHCO3. What the heck, right?</li>
      <br>Well, what I was looking for was a smoothness in the flavour that wasn’t coming about with all the acid in the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce (or any vinegar I tried). The acid bite just kept bothering me. <br>
          I finally decided to neutralize it with the baking soda and found 1/4 is the perfect amount. We’re doing this before we add the acid from the Worcestershire sauce so that we’re not totally without acidity.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>This is really important – once you drop in the baking soda and start stirring, it’s going to start to foam. You’ll need to stir continuously until the foaming subsides.</li>
      <li>The ketchup should look almost exactly like normal ketchup again once you’re done. It will just taste a little different.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat down to low. Add all the wonderfully aromatic spices and give it a nice stir.</li>
      <li>Add the liquids, combine thoroughly and it should look something like this. Simmer on the stove for 5 – 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>The currywurst sauce that you get at an Imbiss will be a lot more liquid. I liked the flavour and consistency of this, so I went with it</li>
      <li>Next up is the bratwurst. This recipe makes a lot of sauce, so pan fry up (or grill) as many bratwurst as you want for your meal</li>
      <li>Okay, so once the brats are fried, slice ’em up and smother in currywurst sauce. Serve with a crusty roll or bread to mop up any extra sauce on the plate. Also, fries. Both potato and sweet potato fries taste great with this.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing to note is that currywurst is ALWAYS served with a sprinkling of curry powder on top!</p>
