odin recipe project

Odin has asked me to use all my html knowledge so far to make a basic recipe website. It will not look very good as it only using html and not css.

git remote -v to check orgin (look for HTTP:)
if HTTP
change with git remote set-url orgin git@github.com:Disturbedm/odin-recipes.git
